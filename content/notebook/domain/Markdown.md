Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

## The Basics

You should be able to *do this* and **this** - basic formatting options. Wierdly, there is no underline in markdown - so no need to do that.

Next, you should be able to create links - like [this](https://standup-philosophy.netlify.app/) - that link will go to the standup philosophy blog I have.
